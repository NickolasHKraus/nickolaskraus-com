**Date**: September 5th, 2020 - September 11th, 2020

On September 5th, 2020, I am 41 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon.

### Training
#### Strength Training
My 5x5 training program is starting to plateau, so I plan to change my programming next week.

**Current Stats**
* Squat: 275 lb. 5x5
* Deadlift: 385 lb. 5x5
* Bench: 235 lb. 5x5

#### Swim
Swimming has become immensely more enjoyable now that I have incorporated bilateral breathing. Before I would breath on my left side every 4th stroke:
```
BL, SL, SR, SL, SR, BL...
^                   ^
```

This left me starved for oxygen and 1-hour sessions would feel like an hour of waterboarding.†

The following cadence is much more suitable:
```
BL, SL, SR, SL, BR, SR, SL, SR, BL...
^               ^               ^
```
* `BL` = Breath Left
* `BR` = Breath Right
* `SL` = Stroke Left
* `SL` = Stroke Right

†: The feeling of drowning is extremely uncomfortable, but does not necessarily precede unconsciousness. This is due to the multiple levels of protection built into the human body to prevent hypoxia of the brain. For example, the spleen, which mainly acts as a blood filter, also holds a reservoir of oxygen-rich red blood cells that can be deployed in emergencies.

Two 60-minute sessions this week:
* 12 x 200 yd. repeats (sub-2:00/100 yd. pace) with an additional interval (300 yd.) to finish

Swimming is quickly becoming my favorite activity. Not only is it therapeutic for the mind and body, but my 200 yd. interval times continue to decrease.

#### Ride
One 60-minute indoor ride.
* 60 min. @ 226 W (2.74 W/kg)

Slipped a little on my FTP test.

#### Run
Two 60-minute treadmill runs.
* 60 min. @ 7.9 mi/h
* 60 min. @ 8.0 mi/h

My running sessions continue to improve.

### Nutrition
This weekend I indulged a little more than I would have liked. I am under no illusions that a 100% clean diet is sustainable, so when I feel like having a cheat meal, I do. The key is to apply mindfulness techniques to the act of indulgence, so that the cheat meal is fully satisfying. I plan to layout my strategies for maximizing the joy while minimizing the harm of cheat meals or cheat days.

I have been incorporating a lot of fermented foods into my diet recently. These foods include:
* Kombucha
* Sauerkraut
* Kimchi
* Pickled Beets

### Supplementation
Nothing new to report.

### Summary
After a seemingly low-quality weekend of training and eating, I was able to bounce back hard and have a great week. Next week I plan to layout my training, nutrition, and supplementation regiment that I have been honing for several weeks.
