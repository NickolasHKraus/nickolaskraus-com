#### Swim
Two 1-hour sessions this week:
* 12 x 200 yd. repeats (~2:00/100 yd. pace)

#### Ride
Two sessions this week: FTP test and 2-hour endurance ride.

On my FTP test, I had the following results:
* 60 min. @ 232 W (2.91 W/kg)

#### Run
This week I did one 5K and one 10K treadmill run:
* **Walk**: 5 min. @ 3.5 mi/h (0:17:09 min/mi)
* **Warm Up**: 5 min. @ 6.5 mi/h (0:09:14 min/mi)
* **Training**: 20 min. or 40 min. @ (target)
* **Cool Down**: 5 min. @ 3.5 mi/h (0:17:09 min/mi)

Where my training pace was 9.5 mi/h (0:06:19 min/mi) on Monday (5K) and 8.2 mi/h (0:07:19 min/mi) on Wednesday (10K).

### Nutrition
I have been experimenting with various eating strategies. A problem I am trying to solve is how to balance energy and productivity throughout the day for both work and training.

**Goals**:
* Spend less time preparing, eating, and cleaning up meals
* Feel satiated throughout the day
* Have focus, concentration, and mental clarity
* Have enough energy to workout in the afternoon

In order to accomplish these goals, I have implemented the following protocol:
* Eat twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening)
* Eat a high-fat breakfast on rest days, eat a balanced breakfast on strength training days

**High-Fat Breakfast**
* Eggs, Cucumber, Avocado, Raspberries, Athletic Greens, Supplements

**Balanced Breakfast**
* Oats, Whey Protein, Coconut Flakes, Flaxseeds, Almond Butter, Almond Milk, Kiwi, Athletic Greens, Supplements

Though its argued that a low-carb, high-fat diet promotes better mental clarity and cognitive performance, both of the meals above kept me satiated and focused throughout the day. My energy did start to wane leading into my endurance sessions, so an additional boost from my pre-workout supplement stack (see below) was needed.

### Supplementation
This week I am adding a pre-workout stack to my strength training sessions and long (+2 hour brick sessions):
* [Thorne Amino Complex](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/amino-complex-berry)
* [Thorne Beta Alanine-SR](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/beta-alanine-sr)
* [Thorne Perfusia-SR®](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/perfusia-sr-reg)

I plan on creating a comprehensive blog post on the benefits of this supplement stack for both strength and endurance in the future.

### Summary
This week I did something that I have not done in years — I took a nap. On Saturday, after my morning brick with world champion triathlete Lee Whalther, I was absolutely wiped out. No so much from the workout, but from the slow decline of my sleep. After reading a page or two of Alex Hutchinson’s *Endure*, I started drifting and ended up sleeping for two hours. Upon waking I felt extremely refreshed. Nevertheless, this was a clear indication that my body lacked adequate recovery and my mounting fatigue needed to be proactively remedied.
