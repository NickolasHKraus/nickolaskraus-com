**Excerpt**: Training, nutrition, and supplementation for Week 5 of IRONMAN training.

**Date**: August 29th, 2020

I am 42 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon.

### Training
#### 36K Run
On Saturday I completed a 36km run with a local group of athletes. I always find training with a partner or group a huge force multiplier, since I am more motivated to explore the limits of strength, endurance, and will.

**Goal**
* Distance: 22mi (~35.4km)
* Time: 3h
* Pace: 8:00 min/mi (~5:00 min/km)

**Pre-Workout**
```
5:30 - Pre-Workout
 • 5g Creatine
 • 400mg Caffeine
 • 8g BCAAs (2:1:1)
 • 1T MCT Oil
 • 2.8g Salt
 • 1.5L Water
```

**Intra-Workout**
```
None
```

**Post-Workout**
```
10:30 - Post-Workout
 • 2 scoops Athletic Greens
 • 500mL Coconut Water
 • 5.7g Salt
 • 2L Water
```

My pre and post-workout supplementation is relatively straightforward, however I continue to experiment with supplementation in regard to performance and recovery. In addition, I added new challenges to this run:
1. Consume nothing (no water, no electrolytes, no fuel)
2. Be in a state of relative glycogen deletion

**Note**: I will discuss water and electrolytes in a future article. Suffice it to say, drinking water and replenishing electrolytes is not so crucial an activity as we are meant to believe.

The goal of this experiment was to push the limit of my physical endurance by artificially handicapping a function of physiological performance, namely fuel. In short, I wanted to feel what it's like to bonk.

On Friday, I ate a ~750kcal omelet (eggs, vegetables, avocado) at around 17:00 as my only meal. So few calories and carbohydrates (~15g) would certainly have depleted some of my glycogen stores and put me in a mild state of ketosis.

**Outcome**
* For 22 miles (35km), I ran at a sub-8 min/mi (sub-5 min/km ) pace, however, at mile 23, I hit a wall. Even though I told my legs to move, I could not sustain my target pace. I dropped to a 5:20 min/km (8:34 min/mi) pace for the final mile.

**Sunday Morning Status**
* Recovery: 9/10
* Resting Heart Rate: Low 40s†

†: I am hoping that this is an indication of increased parasympathetic tone and cardiac efficieny, not that I am suffering serious adrenal fatigue.

**Reflections**
* This was the first run where I achieved a true *runner’s high*. I am no puritan. I’ve gotten high using various pharmacological components, however, this was on a different level. I understand why ex-addicts equate the feeling the runner's high to heroin.
* Looking at my training data, I have done 104 workouts since May 8th (the day I started using my Garmin). I can not recall a workout where the thought of cutting it short did not cross my mind. Of my 104 workouts, I gave in to this temptation only once. For the remaining 103 workouts, I am continually surprised by what the human body is capable of.
* All in all, I am coming away from this experience with a greater respect for intra-workout supplementation and nutrition. I will definitely be refining my protocol in the future to prevent the steep decline in performance I experienced.

#### Big 5x5
On Sunday, I set a personal record for 5x5 for all three powerlifting lifts (squat, deadlift, bench) in a single session:
* Squat: 275 lb. 5x5
* Deadlift: 375 lb. 5x5
* Bench: 235 lb. 5x5

**Pre-Workout**
```
6:00 - Pre-Workout
 • 5g Creatine
 • 400mg Caffeine
 • 8g BCAAs (2:1:1)
 • 3.2g Beta-Alanine
 • 4g L-Arginine†
 • 2.8g Salt
 • 1.5L Water
```

†: Citrulline supplementation is more efficient at increasing arginine availability than is arginine supplementation itself[1], therefore I may be transitioning to citrulline in the future.

**Intra-Workout**
```
8:00 - Intra-Workout
 • 8g BCAAs (2:1:1)
 • 2.8g Salt
 • 1L Water
```

**Post-Workout**
```
10:00 - Post-Workout
 • 2 scoops Athletic Greens
 • 2 scoops Athletic Greens Whey Protein
 • 500mL Coconut Water
 • 5.6g Salt
 • 1L Water
```

### Nutrition
This meal can be made the night before, allowing me to eat a solid breakfast after strength training and before starting work. Optimizing efficiency and quality is key.

**Overnight Oats**
* 1 cup Oats
* 1 scoop Whey Protein
* 1/4 cup Coconut Flakes
* 2 tbsp. Flaxseed
* 1/4 tsp. Sea Salt
* 1/4 cup Almond Butter
* 1/2 cup Almond Milk

**Calories**: 962 kcal | **Carbs**: 88g | **Fiber**: 22g | **Fat**: 53g | **Protein**: 46g

**Note**: 66g of net carbohydrate.

### Supplementation
I am adding caffeine back into my routine.

#### Morning
* 300 mg - Caffeine†
* 5000 mg - Creatine Monohydrate

†: 3.75 mg/kg is the most efficacious dose of caffeine for me.

### Summary
Fatigue, depression, and lack of motivation are all signs of overtraining. This week I decided to reduce my training volume in order to let my body recovery.
