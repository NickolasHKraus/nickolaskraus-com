**Date**: September 12th, 2020 - September 18th, 2020

On September 12th, 2020, I am 40 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon.

This week was all about establishing a bulletproof routine for training, nutrition, and supplementation.

### Training

	* Complete

	* Squat: 315 lb. x 1 (2-second pause), Deadlift: 425 lb. x 1 (1-second pause)

	* 49.39 km | 1:47:25 | 27.6 kph

**Monday**

**Friday**
* Morning: Strength Training (Bench 3x6)

#### Reflections
* On Monday and Thursday, I like to take a rest day from strength training. This ensures that I never strength train three days in a row, which, for me, leads to fatigue and can result in injury.
* By Friday, I was very fatigued and did not have the motivation to train in the afternoon.

†: I need to get more sleep. On Sunday I got ~10 hours of sleep and pulled 425 lb. x 1. On Wednesday I got ~7.5 hours of sleep and pulled 405 lb. x 1.

* I try to consume all food and supplements within a 12-hour window (6:00 - 18:00) to align with my circadian rhythm.
* Monday through Friday, I make my breakfast the night before. This ensures I have adequate time to eat before starting my work day.
