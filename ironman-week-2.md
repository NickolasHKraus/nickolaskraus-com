**Date**: August 8th, 2020

I am 45 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon will now debut on **June 20, 2021**. I will be taking this time to train, learn, and grow as a triathlete.

### Training
#### Strength Training
My lifts are still increasing using the following protocol:

**Squat**

In addition, I have been working stability exercises into my routine such as pistol squat and single leg dumbbell deadlift.

#### Swim
My go-to workout for swim sessions has been the following:
* 6 x 200 yd. repeats (~2:00/100 yd. pace)

#### Ride
Cycling has been my recovery lately. When I am tired or unmotivated, I jump on the bike and grind out a one hour session.

#### Run
This week I did two 10K treadmill runs:
* **Walk**: 5 min. @ 3.5 mi/h (0:17:09 min/mi)
* **Warm Up**: 5 min. @ 6.5 mi/h (0:09:14 min/mi)
* **Training**: 40 min. @ (target)
* **Cool Down**: 5 min. @ 3.5 mi/h (0:17:09 min/mi)

Where my training pace was 8.0 mi/h (0:07:30 min/mi) on Wednesday and 8.1 mi/h (0:07:24 min/mi) on Friday.

#### Brick Workout
On Saturday, August 8th, 2020, I completed an indoor brick workout after 16 hours of fasting. The supplementation stack that I used for this session is detailed below. My stats were:
* Ride: 60 min. @ 221 W (2.76 W/kg)
* Run: 60 min. @ 7.8 mi/h (7:42 min/mi)

### Nutrition
My nutrition continues to be consistent. One strategy that I have been using to attenuate my compulsion to binge when eating with family is to eat a *massive* amount of salad and vegetables. The sheer volume is enough to sate my hungry, which would otherwise be put to work on more calorie dense foods (or desserts).

### Supplementation
For my fasted brick session, I did some experimentation with caffeine + MCT oil. About 1 hour prior to exercise, I consumed:
* 200 mg Caffeine
* 2x Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee
* 2 T Bulletproof MCT Oil

Caffeine has many proven benefits in terms of physical and cognitive performance, however the addition of MCT oil was aimed at providing metabolic substrate in the form of fat (medium chain triglycerides). MCTs, unlike long-chain fatty acids, are delivered directly to the liver via hepatic portal circulation and are responsible for stimulating ketone production and enhancing beta oxidation of fatty acids.

**Warning**: 2 T of MCT oil resulted in stomach discomfort and nausea while biking. It was only after the workout that I learned that the recommended dose is 1 T per hour in order to avoid gastrointestinal issues.

### Summary
Life is unpredictable. On Monday, a severe storm knocked out power to most of Ames, Iowa causing the gyms to close Monday afternoon until Tuesday night. This was more a psychological disruption, than anything, as I do not like to change my workout schedule once it has been established. Nevertheless, on Tuesday, when I could easily have skipped training, I got in a 30 minute ride. Small decisions like that — doing a workout versus skipping a workout — accrete, building discipline and sharpening resolve. **Never skip a workout**.
