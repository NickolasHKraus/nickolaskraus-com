**Date**: October 3rd, 2020 - October 9th, 2020

On October 3rd, 2020, I am 37 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon.

My goal is to slowly increase volume and focus heavily on sleep and recovery in order to avoid the onset of burnout that occurred during my last 8 week cycle.

### Training
I have been increasing volume throughout the week, however, I have found that I prefer short, high-intensity sessions over long, medium-intensity sessions. To be honest, I get bored completing long sessions day in, day out and there is a serious opportunity cost that I incur when training in this way. More training means less time doing other things I enjoy.

### Nutrition
I continue to use time-restricted eating to increase productivity and manage food consumption. There are a number of benefits that come with fasting, however my main goal is to increase productivity by reducing the amount of time I spend preparing, eating, and cleaning up a meal.

### Supplementation
Nothing new here. I did some experimentation with a few nootropic compounds, but nothing worth documenting.

### Sleep
This week my sleep was poor due to a sick pup. The sleep deprivation I experienced gave me some valuable insights into how I feel and perform with adequate and inadequate sleep. Time and time again I convince myself that sleep can be curtailed in order to increase the amount of productive hours I have in the day. Upon closer inspection, a few days with less than 7.5 hours of sleep will reliably reduce my motivation and productivity by at least 25%. Given an 8-hour work day, that is 2 hours per day that I am not operating at my best. The fact that an extra hour of sleep each night seems to vanquish this dip in performance makes the argument for prioritizing sleep indisputable.
