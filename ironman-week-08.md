**Date**: September 19th, 2020 - September 25th, 2020

On September 19th, 2020, I am 39 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon.

This week was all about refining my routine for training, nutrition, and supplementation.

In addition, I was on call for [work](https://granular.ag). With the combination of 9-10 hour work days and the lack of sleep I would inevitably receive, I reduced training volume significantly.

### Training

**Saturday**
* Morning: Run (Long)
	* 22.36 km | 1:50:51 | 4:57 min/km
* Morning: Sauna (45-minute session)
	* Complete

**Sunday**
* Rest

**Monday**
* Afternoon: Run (High-Intensity)
	* 6.08 km | 25:00 | 4:07 min/km

**Tuesday**
* Afternoon: Swim (Intervals)
	* 1,200 yd | 29:41 | 1:38 min/100 yd

**Wednesday**
* Morning: Sauna (45-minute session)
	* Complete

**Thursday**
* Afternoon: Run (High-Intensity)
	* 6.08 km | 25:00 | 4:07 min/km

**Friday**
* Afternoon: Swim (Intervals)
	* 1,200 yd | 29:52 | 1:39 min/100 yd

#### Reflections
* On Sunday, I took a **complete** rest day. I went for a morning hike with my wife and dog, bought several pumpkins, and had an all-around relaxing day.
* This week I did not set an alarm. Instead I let my body wake up naturally. This has had **significant** positive benefits on my mood, focus, and concentration.

### Nutrition
* This week I skipped breakfast every day and broke my fast around 12:00 to 13:00 with my **High-Fat Shake**.

### Supplementation
* I bumped caffeine to 400mg. Honestly, I just got tired of splitting the 200mg pills.
* I reduced L-Arginine from 4g to 2g.
* I stopped consuming my **Post-Workout** shake.
