**Date**: September 26th, 2020 - October 2nd, 2020

On September 26th, 2020, I am 38 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon.

### Training
I have really been enjoying short, high-intensity training sessions lately.

### Nutrition
Likewise, I am loving my new time-restricted eating protocol:
* 6:00 - Morning Supplements
* 7:00 - Pre-Workout (Strength Training)†
* 9:00 - Coffee (Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee or 12oz. Black Coffee)
* 13:00 - High-Fat Shake
* 18:00 - Dinner

†: Only on strength training days.

In addition, a marked improvement in sleep and a reduction in training volume has made my relationship with food significantly better. I am less likely to binge and more comfortable with having the occasional, mindful treat. This approach, a 80-20 style of eating, is sometimes referred to as flexible dieting.

### Supplementation
Nothing new to report.

### Summary
This week I slept an average of 8.0-8.5 hours each night.

**Sleep Time**
* Saturday: 6:01
* Sunday: 8:41
* Monday: 8:11
* Tuesday: 6:35
* Wednesday: 7:39
* Thursday: 7:44
* Friday: 8:09

**Note**: Sleep duration was taken from my Garmin and is not very accurate. I am looking into purchasing an [Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/) for sleep tracking.
