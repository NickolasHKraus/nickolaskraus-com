**Date**: August 1st, 2020 - August 7th, 2020

On August 1st, 2020, I am 9 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon. I am focused and determined to be as fit as possible for the race. Below I share my training, nutrition, and supplementation.

### Training
#### Strength Training
> *"Strong athletes finish races."*

My strength training consists of heavy squat, deadlift, and bench in a three day rotation with full body days for recovery when needed. Repetitions fall within the 1-6 range to bias strength over hypertrophy.

#### Swim
I have made it a goal to get in the pool 3-4 times per week. For swimming, frequency and consistency is key. Low-volume, technical sessions are preferred over long, endurance-focused sessions.

#### Ride
I alternate between long road rides and highly-focused Functional Threshold Power (FTP) sessions on an indoor trainer. The ride is my strongest discipline, so I reduced volume and frequency in order to focus on my swim and run.

**Note**: Functional Threshold Power (FTP) represents your ability to sustain the highest possible power output for 60 minutes.

#### Run
I have tended more toward high-intensity workouts after establishing a solid aerobic base after months of long runs. I find short, focused sessions motivating. These sessions usually include 5K and 10K working sessions where I aim to beat my previous personal best.

#### Sauna
Frequent use of sauna has huge physiological and psychological benefits which I will discuss in a future post. I try to sauna 4-5 times per week for 45 minutes at ~175°F.

#### Cold Therapy
Cold Therapy is another activity that elicits highly positive physiological and psychological effects on the body. I try to use cold therapy 2-3 times per week for 20 minutes at ~45°F.

#### Mobility
For flexibility before and after training, I work in mobility sessions lasting 15 to 20-minutes. I try to do this 6-7 times per week.

### Nutrition
I have doubled down on my nutrition by implementing my personal technique of *mindful eating*. With this approach, I adhere to a few simple rules:
1. Eat whole foods. Not too much. Mostly plants with high-quality protein.
2. Treat every meal as a blessing. Relish the preparation and fully enjoy the sensation of eating.
3. Make every meal visually appealing. Take a picture of each meal, then only eat what’s in the picture.

Following these three simple rules, I can find equanimity in my relationship with food.

#### Full Day of Eating

### Summary
For the first few months of training, I threw everything I could at my body — increasing volume every week, always trying to beat my personal bests. This lead to vacillations in mood, energy, willpower, and sleep. For this reason, I have restructured my training to optimize for efficiency, quality, and recovery.

That’s all for this week. Stay tuned for future posts, as I will be delving deeper into my training, nutrition, and supplementation.
