---

**Date**: August 22nd, 2020

I am 43 weeks out from the IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines triathlon.

### Training
This week was a little lighter, since I was feeling drained from two monster strength training sessions from the weekend.

#### Swim
Two 45-minute sessions this week:
* 8 x 200 yd. repeats (~2:00/100 yd. pace)

#### Ride
One 60-minute easy ride.

#### Run
Two 60-minute runs (one treadmill, one trail).

#### Cold Therapy
Since August 1st I have consistently been taking cold morning showers. It is a great way to steel oneself for the day and induced thermogenesis.

### Nutrition
Sometimes your body will tell you it needs more food. You will feel fatigued and irritable. Listen to your body and **eat healthy, whole food**.

#### Fat Shake
I have been experimenting with different morning nutrition protocols. Here is one: the **Fat Shake**.

**Fat Shake**
* 1 scoop Athletic Greens
* 1 scoop Athletic Greens Whey Protein
* 4 cup Kale
* 1/2 Avocado
* 1/4 cup Coconut (Shredded, Unsweetened)
* 1/4 cup Walnuts
* 1 tbsp. Golden Flaxseeds
* 1 tbsp. Bulletproof Brain Octane Oil
* 1/2 tsp. Sea Salt
* 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. Cocoa Powder (Unsweetened)
* 1 cup Almond Milk (Unsweetened)

**Calories**: 959 kcal | **Carbs**: 52g | **Fiber**: 27g | **Fat**: 68g | **Protein**: 45g

**Note**: 25g of net carbohydrate.

### Supplementation
This week I stopped my **Nootropic Stack**.

* 750 mg - Aniracetam
* 200 mg - Caffeine
* 250 mg - Citicoline
* 5000 mg - Creatine Monohydrate†
* 1600 mg - Piracetam

†: I have continued to take 5 grams of creatine monohydrate upon waking.

### Summary
Stopping my caffeine use was not fun. Not only did I feel a marked drop in energy, alertness, and motivation, but, counterintuitively, my sleep suffered severely. I have never experienced insomnia, however, this week I would find myself lying in bed for 2-3 hours every night, drifting in and out of a restless sleep. My hunch, though unfounded, is that the L-Theanine that I take in my Sleep Stack may have precipitated wakefulness without the counteracting effect of caffeine. Suffice it to say, this week was not fun, but cycling stimulants is critical to prevent the development of tolerance.
